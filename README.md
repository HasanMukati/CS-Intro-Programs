# CS-Intro-Programs
These are some sample programs you can 
look into to get your feet wet in Java. 

Many projects and programs are assignment driven, while "Healthapp" 
is a project of my own. Currently it's a very basic program that 
allows you to input your burned calories and it returns what items 
you may be able to eat based on that data and a few "If" statements.

Eventually, I would like to optimize this program and make it so it
connects to your phones health app and/or other third part health 
apps. With that data and a bigger data base of foods' calories, I want 
to calculate which items a person can consume and how many of each 
they might be able to. 

Other wise please let me know if you have 
any other questions or suggestions. 

I will continue to add to this repository as I progress

Classes Covered: Intro To Programming, Computer Science 1&2, Software Development Methods.
